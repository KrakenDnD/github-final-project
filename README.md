## 🎯 About

This Simple Interest Calculator is designed to be a lightweight, accessible tool for calculating simple interest. It's particularly useful for:

- **Micro-finance institutions** calculating loan interest
- **Small business owners** planning financial projections
- **Students** learning about financial calculations
- **Individuals** making personal financial decisions

### Why Simple Interest?

Simple interest is calculated using the formula: **Interest = Principal × Rate × Time**

Unlike compound interest, simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, making it easier to understand and more commonly used in short-term loans and basic financial planning.

- 🎯 **Simple interface**: Interactive command-line prompts
- 📊 **Accurate calculations**: Reliable mathematical operations
- 🔧 **Lightweight**: No external dependencies required
- 📝 **Well-documented**: Clear code comments and documentation
- 🌍 **Open source**: Apache 2.0 licensed

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

3. Run it: `./simple-interest.sh`

### Method 2: Clone Repository

### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Principal (p)** | The initial amount of money | 1000 |
| **Rate (r)** | Annual interest rate (as percentage) | 5 |
| **Time (t)** | Time period in years | 2 |

### Output

The script calculates: **Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100**

## 📊 Examples

### Example 1: Personal Loan
```
Enter the principal: 5000
Enter rate of interest per year: 8
Enter time period in years: 3
The simple interest is: 1200
```

**Calculation**: (5000 × 8 × 3) / 100 = 1200

### Example 2: Micro-finance Loan
```
Enter the principal: 500
Enter rate of interest per year: 12
Enter time period in years: 1
The simple interest is: 60
```

**Calculation**: (500 × 12 × 1) / 100 = 60

### Example 3: Small Business Planning
```
Enter the principal: 10000
Enter rate of interest per year: 6.5
Enter time period in years: 5
The simple interest is: 3250
```

**Calculation**: (10000 × 6.5 × 5) / 100 = 3250
